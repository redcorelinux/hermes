Hermes is a daemon and system tray application pair designed to monitor and notify users about package upgrades on Gentoo Linux and 
Gentoo-derived distributions. It offers a user-friendly interface with background checks to help keep the system up-to-date without
manual intervention.


The redcore branch is developed using Redcore Linux's Sisyphus API. It leverages the Sisyphus/Portage abstractions unique to Redcore Linux, 
providing tight integration and optimized functionality tailored specifically for Redcore users.


The gentoo branch is developed to be compatible with Gentoo and any Gentoo-derived distributions using Portage. This branch avoids abstraction 
layers and instead relies on standard Gentoo tools and methods to ensure reliable upgrade checking and notifications across these systems.


Both branches deliver the same core functionality—monitoring for package upgrades and notifying the user—but utilize different methods according 
to their target distributions.


Runs as a background daemon to periodically check for system updates.
Provides a system tray application to notify users about available package upgrades.
Supports seamless monitoring on both Redcore Linux (master branch) and Gentoo-based distributions (gentoo branch).
Simplifies keeping Gentoo and its derivatives up-to-date through timely upgrade alerts.
